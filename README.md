# The [enigmapython](https://github.com/denismaggior8/enigma-python) wrapper package for MicroPython environment

I'm thrilled to announce that [enigmapython](https://github.com/denismaggior8/enigma-python), my powerful Enigma machine emulator, is now available on [MicroPython](https://micropython.org)! ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ Why is this exciting?

[enigmapython](https://github.com/denismaggior8/enigma-python) isnâ€™t just a package... itâ€™s a historically accurate and educational tool that allows students, researchers, and history enthusiasts to explore WWII cryptography hands-on. 

Now, with MicroPython support, you can run it on embedded devices like ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, and other microcontrollers!

ðŸ”¹ How This Helps Education & Research

âœ… Cryptography Lessons â€“ Learn how encryption shaped history by experimenting with real Enigma machine settings on resource-constrained devices.

âœ… Historical Research â€“ Recreate encoded wartime messages and decrypt them just like WWII codebreakers.

âœ… STEM & Embedded Systems â€“ Run an Enigma emulator on a microcontroller, making learning cryptography more interactive than ever!

## Installation

Using mip (on network enabled devices):

```python
import mip
mip.install("github:denismaggior8/micropython-enigma-python", version="1.2.3")
```

## Releases

This repo mirrors the **enigmapython** releases on PyPi, meaning that by installing micropython-enigma-python version 1.2.3 (as in the example above) you get the **enigmapython** 1.2.3 PyPi equivalent.
